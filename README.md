# 💥 Chopper Hunter  

_A personal project inspired by the classic **Heli Attack 2** by SquareCircleCo. Built to test and improve my C++ skills._  

As a soldier trapped behind enemy lines, your fate is sealed — but before you fall, you have one final mission: **take as many helicopters down with you as possible.**  
Survive wave after wave of enemies, and see how long you can last before succumbing to your injuries.
